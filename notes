SYNOPSIS
========

    Summary of Abtract Data Types and Algorithm.

    Although main content of this notes is Abtract Data Types and Algorithm,
    it is necessary to describe some concepts related with PHYSICAL_SCIENCE
    and use that knowledge to specific Abstract Data Types and Algorithm.
    That way make clear view than only specific any things in abstract.
    This is addition of Kevin Leptons, not a part of CS106B.

MATTER
======

    MATTER is everything. Everything is MATTER. That is simple definition of
    MATTER. Your book is MATTER, your hair is MATTER, yourself is MATTER,
    environment around you is MATTER. In real, MATTER's definition is not
    complete because human still have enough knowledge about it.

    Do you feel that we are far from CS106B? Yes, we do. Let's imagine that
    we are in border of Sun System, CS106B is the Sun and we need to pass
    through each sub-plan before we are in the Sun.

    Why do we should care about MATTER?. At all, human is MATTER, everything
    which human invents is MATTER and it interacts together. COMPUTER and
    COMPUTER_PROGRAMMING is the same.

INFORMATION
===========

    It describe properties of MATTER. It is impossible to show "How is
    INFORMATION look like?" because INFORMATION is abstract concepts. For
    example, two lines below describes a person then meaning of two lines is
    INFORMATION:

        name: kevin leptons
        gender: male

    As above, name and gender describes for a person, but it is not all. In
    real world, MATTER contains many INFORMATION and human still not able to
    know INFORMATION is limited or not. Why?, because PHYSICAL_SCIENCE always
    find new PATRICULATE_MATTER, smaller and can not proof that
    "There are smallest PATRICULATE_MATTER". COMPUTER_SCIENCE knows that
    INFORMATION is big and find the way to work with it.

    Don't misstake INFORMATION and DATA. As above example, meaning of two
    lines is INFORMATION, not two lines. Two lines is DATA and will be present
    in next section.

DATA
====

    It is MATTER which arrange follow set of rules to represents for
    INFORMATION. Good news, DATA is MATTER and it is able tow show "How DATA
    look like?". For example, with name and gender of a person, human use
    writting language to represent to that's INFORMATION, and it is DATA:

        name: kevin leptons
        gender: male

    Now, above DATA have 19 + 12 = 31 characters. Characters is English
    alphabet, rules is English. And of course, characters is able to see.

    INFORMATION can be represents by more than one DATA. Here is DATA in
    Spanish version represent for same INFORMATION above:

       nombre: kevin leptons
       g√©nero: masculino

       <by translate.google.com>

DATA_STORAGE
============

    It is MATTER which use to store DATA. If write two lines information about
    a person above into paper, paper is DATA_STORAGE. If write that lines into
    stone, stone is DATA_STORAGE.

DATA_STRUCTURES
===============

    It is concepts includes location of DATA in DATA_STORAGE and relationship
    between DATA.

    If you have 10 empty papers, then you decide to write table content in
    first paper; with each of rest of 9 papers, you decide to describe
    you, your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, your house,
    your dog, your garden, one of your boy and girl friend. That is
    DATA_STRUCTURE.

ALGORITHM
=========

    It is describes "How to work with DATA?". ALGORITHM includes three parts:

        Input: describes source DATA
        Output: describes destination DATA
        Operations: describes how to get destination DATA from source DATA

    For examples, here is ALGORITHM to find person with name:

        Input: List of person
        Output:
            On found return first person who have name
            On not found return NOT_FOUND
        Operations:
            for each person in Input:
                if name of person is same with name:
                    return person
            return NOT_FOUND

    Defination above use PESUDO_CODE but ALGORITHM can be show by any things
    such as paragraphs, images, sound or videos and it describes INPUT_DATA,
    OUPUT_DATA, OPERATIONS.

ALGORITHM_COMPLEXITY
====================

    ALGORITHM_COMPLEXITY is function show "How OPERATION_AMOUNT change while
    input's DATA_AMOUNT change?" and applies for number ALGORITHM.

    Why ALGORITHM_COMPLEXITY applies for only number ALGORITHM?. Because it's
    definition related with two concepts OPERATION_AMOUNT which base on
    numbers.

    OPERATION_AMOUNTS is quantitive of OPERATIONS. It is calculates by sum all
    of PRIMITIVE_OPERATIONS. PRIMITIVE_OPERATIONS applies for operations with
    numbers, include: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, ASN, >, >=, <, <=, ==. Binary
    numbers have more PRIMITIVE_OPERATIONS, include: SHIFT, AND, OR, NOR, XOR.
    Quanlity of each PRIMITIVE_OPERATIONS is one.

    DATA_AMOUNT is quantitive of DATA, any DATA is quantitive. It is number of
    element of data. In this case, it is number of element of input data.

    For example, here is ALGORITHM to calculate total of numbers:

        Input: List with n numbers
        Output: Total of numbers of input
        Operations:
            total = 0                     			// 1
            for (i = 0; i < n; i++):                // 1; n(1 + 1)
				total = total + input[i]			// 1 + 1
            return total

    Complexity of above ALGORITHM is:

        f(n) = 1 + 1 + n(1 + 1)(1 + 1)
             = 4n + 2

BIG_O
=====

    BIG-O is notation show "What biggest factor affect to
    ALGORITHM_COMPLEXITY?". In simple, from complexity function, strip all
    of constants and chose biggest factor and it is BIG-O.

	With complex algorithms, get extract ALGORITHM_COMPLEXITY
    function is hard or depend on other factors than DATA_AMOUNT. Best way
	is use worst case of loops, strip for constants to get worst
	ALGORITHM_COMPLEXITY, then get Big-O from that function.

	For example, here is ALGORITHM to sort an list of number by increasing.

        Input: List of n numbers
        Output: List of n numbers by increasing
        Operations:
            for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++):                // 2(n - 1)
                for (k = i + 1; k < n; k++):            // 2(n - 1)
                    if (input[i] > input[k]):           // 1
                        tmp = input[i]                  // 1
                        input[i] = input[k]             // 1
                        input[k] = tmp                  // 1
            return input

        Worst ALGORITHM_COMPLEXITY: f(n) = 2(n - 1).2(n - 1)(1 + 1 + 1 + 1)
                                         = 16(n^2 -2n - 1)
        Strip all of constants: g(n) = n^2 - n
        Chose biggest factor: BIG-0 = O(n^2)

DT
==

    DT is Data Types. It is wrap of DATA_STRUCTURE and related ALGORITHMS.

ADT
===

    ADT is Abstract Data Type. It only specify INPUT and OUTPUT of ALGORITHM.
    So, it doesn't specifies OPERATIONS. People is free to use DATA_STRUCTURES
    and ALGORITHMS to implemnt specification of ADT.

    It is possible to specify ADT by any things which can describes it.
    However, better ADT should be specify by an programming language and
    text. If possible, images is additional to help people easy to
    understand about ADT. In next sections, C language is use to describle
    ADT.

    Why ADT is useful?. Because:

        - It represents for many INFORMATION in real world
        - It is more simple to write than do from scratch
        - It is more simple to read than none ADT

ARRAYS - ADT
============

    ARRAYS use to store/retrieve items, index by sequence numbers from zero
    and size of ARRAY can not be change.

    struct array {};
    int array_init(struct array *array, size_t size);
    int array_set(struct array *array, size_t index, void *value);
    int array_get(struct array *array, size_t index, void **value);
    int array_size(struct array *array);
    int array_free(struct array *array);

    That is programming interfaces for ARRAY. However, C provide built-in
    ARRAY and people always use it instead of implement ARRAY.

    ======================================  =================================
    ARRAY interfaces                        C array interfaces
    ======================================  =================================

    array_get()                             value = array[index]
    array_size()                            sizeof(array) / sizeof(type)

    size_t queue_size(struct queue *queue);

GRIDS - ADT
===========

    Grid is use to store/retrieve items with two indexes, row and col.
    Size of grid is not automatic change, it require specific call to do
    that.

    struct grid {};
    int grid_init(struct grid *grid, size_t row_size, size_t col_size);
    int grid_resize(struct grid *grid, size_t row_size, size_t col_size);

    int grid_free(struct grid *grid);
    size_t grid_row_size(struct grid *grid);
    size_t grid_col_size(struct grid *grid);

    struct str * str_clone(struct str *str);
    size_t str_size(struct str *str);

MAPS - ADT
==========

    MAPS is use to store/retrieve items index by key. Key can be any type,
    however any type can convert into string. Here are MAPS with string key:

    struct map {};
    int map_init(struct map *map);
    int map_get(struct map *map, const char *key, void **value);
    int map_set(struct map *map, const char *key, void *value);
    int map_free(struct map *map);
    size_t map_size(struct map *map);
    struct vector * map_keys(struct map *map);

LINKED_LIST - DATA_STRUCTURE
============================

    It is list of items includes front item, back item and mid items. Each
    item connect together by reference by rules: first and back item is
    connect with one item, mid items is connect with two items.

    Have more than one type of LINKED_LIST. Here are examples:

    struct lklist {                     // two way linked
        struct lklist *next;
        struct lklist *prev;
        // other properties...
    };

    struct lklist_fw {                  // forward linked
        struct lklist *next;
        // other properties...
    };

    struct lklist_bk {                  // back linked
        struct lklist *prev;
        // other properties...
    }

TREES - DATA_STRUCTURE
======================

    It is defined by recursion. Tree can be empty or not. If tree is not
    empty, it includes references to children tree. Children tree can be
    empty, it mean that tree have not children.

    Have more than one type of TREES:

    struct tree_bin {                   // binary tree
        struct tree *left;
        struct tree *right;
        // other properties of tree...
    };

    struct tree_tnr {                   // ternary tree
        struct tree_tnr *left;
        struct tree_tnr *mid;
        struct tree_tnr *right;
        // other properties of tree...
    };

    struct tree {                       // n-ary tree
        struct tree *children;
        // other properties of tree...
    };


BINARY_HEAPS - DT
=================

    It is BINARY_TREE with more specification. If tree and children are mark
    by order from tree, left child and right child, left child and right child
    MUST be fills before create new children of prev tree. Each tree contains
    an number called tree's value. Binary tree divides into two types. First,
    SMALLEST_BINARY_TREES, in that tree, tree's value MUST smaller or equal
    children tree's value. Second, BIGGEST_BINARY_TREES, in that tree, tree's
    value MUST bigger or equal children tree's value. To ensure specification
    is correct, two ALGORITHMS are provides:

    struct bheap {};
    int bheap_add(struct bheap *heap, size_t value);
    int hheap_del(struct bheap *heap, struct bheap *node);

BINARY_SEARCH_TREES - DT
========================

    It is binary tree with more specific. Each tree contaisn an number called
    tree's value. Tree's value of left trees MUST smaller than tree's value
    and tree's value of right tree MUST bigger than tree's value. To ensure
    specificaion is correct four ALGORITHMS are provides:

    struct bst {};
    int bst_add(struct bst *tree, size_t value);
    int bst_del(struct bst *tree, struct bst *node);
    size_t bst_min(struct bst *tree);
    size_t bst_max(struct bst *tree);

GRAPHS - ADT
============

    It is concept contains set of nodes and edges. Each edges is define by
    two nodes. With UNDIRECTED_GRAPHS, two nodes of edges is not order. with
    DIRECTED_GRAPH, two nodes of edges is order and called START_NODE and
    END_NODE.

    struct graph_vertex {};
    struct graph_edge {};
    struct graph {};
    int graph_init(struct graph *g);

    int graph_vadd(struct graph *g, size_t id);
    int graph_vdel(struct graph *g, size_t id);
    struct graph_vertex * graph_vget(struct graph *g, size_t id);
    struct pset * graph_vertexs(struct graph *g);

    int graph_eadd(struct graph *g, size_t begin, size_t end);
    int graph_edel(struct graph *g, size_t begin, size_t end);
    struct graph_edge * graph_eget(struct graph *g, size_t begin , size_t end);
    struct pset *graph_edges(struct graph *g);

    int graph_find(struct graph *g, size_t begin, size_T end, vector *path);
    int graph_walk(struct graph *g, void (*callback)(struct graph_vertex *v));

RECURSIONS - ALGORITHM
======================

    Recursions is an ALGORITHM which have OPERATIONS group into two cases:
    call itself or not.

    Here is general example about RECURSIONS ALGORITHM:

        Name: general_fn
        Input: number
        Output: number
        Operation:
            case 1: return NUMBER
            case 2: general_fn(number)

    Look for specific example, calculate factorial of n.
    Because n! = n(n - 1)! with n > 1 and 1! = 1, so:

        Name: factorial
        Input: Number called n
        Output: Factorial of n
        Operations:
            if (n == 1):
                return 1
            else
                return n * factorial(n - 1)

RECURSION_BACKTRACKING - ALGORITHM
==================================

    It is ABSTRACT_ALGORITHM and it is use to find set of solution start
    from candidate C:

    Name: backtrack
    Input: candidate C
    Output: Set of solutions S
    Operation:
        S = empty
        if accept(C):
            for c in neigbour(C):
                S = S union backtrack(c)
        return S
