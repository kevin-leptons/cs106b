    Summary of Abtract Data Types and Algorithm. However, it describes some
    concepts to clear contents.

INFORMATION
===========

    It describe properties of things. It is impossible to show "How is
    INFORMATION look like?" because INFORMATION is abstract concepts. For
    example, two lines below describes a person then meaning of two lines is
    INFORMATION:

        name: kevin leptons
        gender: male

    As above, name and gender describes for a person, but it is not all. In
    real world, a small thing to a big thing also contains many INFORMATION
    and human still not able to know INFORMATION is limited or not. Why?,
    because Physical Science always find new particulate matter, smaller and
    they can not proof that "There are smallest particulate matter". Computer
    Science knows that INFORMATION is big and find the way to work with it.

    Don't misstake INFORMATION and DATA. As above example, meaning of two
    lines is INFORMATION, not two lines. Two lines is DATA and will be present
    below.

DATA
====

    It is things represents for INFORMATION. Good news, it is able to show
    "How is DATA look like?". For example, with name and gender of a person,
    human use writting language to represent to that's INFORMATION, and it is
    DATA:

        name: kevin leptons
        gender: male

    Now, above DATA have 19 + 12 = 31 characters. Characters is English
    alphabet. And of course, characters is able to see.

    INFORMATION can be represents by more than one DATA. Here is DATA in
    Spanish version with same INFORMATION above:

       nombre: kevin leptons
       g√©nero: masculino

ALGORITHMS
==========

    It is describes "How to work with DATA?". ALGORITHM includes three parts:

        Input: describes source DATA
        Output: describes destination DATA
        Operations: describes how to get destination DATA from source DATA
    
    
    For examples, here is ALGORITHM to find person with name:

        Input: List of person
        Output: 
            On found return first person who have name
            On not found return NOT_FOUND
        Operations:
            for each person in Input:
                if name of person is same with name:
                    return person
            return NOT_FOUND

    Defination above use PESUDO_CODE but ALGORITHM can be show by any things
    such as paragraphs, images, sound or videos and it describes INPUT_DATA,
    OUPUT_DATA, OPERATIONS.

BIG(O)
======

    BIG(O) is notation show "How OPERATION_AMOUNT change while DATA_AMOUNT
    change?".
